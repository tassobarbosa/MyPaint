##Summary

This is a version of the Microsoft Paint software.

It is not intended to look the same as the original because this version is just for practicing.

This is my first Python project, as well as my first Tkinter.

I will contribute here occasionally during free time or for fun.

##Bugs and Not Implemented

-- TopBar
- Save button only export a file, does not create image
- Open, Edit, view, Image, Options, not implemented

-- Tools
- Drawings works as objects, if you try to connect four lines to draw a square
it won't be a square obejct but four single lines

- Ink only fills objects

- Scissors only drag objects, does not cut

- Eraser only draws white lines giving the impressions of clearing
